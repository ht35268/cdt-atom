# C Development Tools for Atom

Support for calling g++. Adds buttons to the [tool-bar](https://atom.io/packages/tool-bar) package
while also retaining keybindings for ease of compilation and execution. The entire
package is currently optimized for participants in Olympiad in Informatics. Further
functions will be added gradually.

Within a considerable time, the code will go through a re-write and support
project options and a few other useful functions that resembles Dev-C++ and/or
Eclipse IDE.
